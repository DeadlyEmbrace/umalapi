umalapi - MyAnimeList Unofficial API
==========================

An unofficial API for http://myanimelist.net/.

Why unofficial?
---------------

MyAnimeList.net's API is stagnant, and there doesn't seem to be any plan to update it. That's annoying. This API is used to provide extra content to the user, including related works, ratings, and tags.

What do I need to run this?
---------------------------
* ruby 1.9.3 or later.
* libxml2 and libxslt (for nokogiri)
* Bundler gem.
* memcached
